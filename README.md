Advanced Unittesting in Python
==============================

This is a presentation I gave to Python Dublin on Wednesday, the 9th of February, 2011.

--Rory Geoghegan

Structure
---------

There are a number of branches describing different phases of the code

 * `a_beginning`: Initial version
 * `b_better_asserts`: Use better asserts
 * `c_setup`: Use setup for tests
 * `d_setup_slow`: Test with sleep to slow down
 * `e_setup_class`: Use setupClass to speed up test
 * `f_mock`: Use mock
 * `g_mock_patch`: Use mock_patch

Fixtures
--------

The a_beginning and b_better_asserts version of the tests require some fixtures to be built. This can be done with the `create.sql` file, sqlite3 and the following command:

    sqlite3 -batch test.sqlite '.read create.sql'
